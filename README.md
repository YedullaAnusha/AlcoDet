##  How It Works

1. **Alcohol Detection**: The MQ-3 sensor detects ethanol levels from a personâ€™s breath.
2. **Temperature & Humidity Monitoring**: The DHT11 sensor records environmental conditions.
3. **Real-Time Alerts**: If alcohol levels cross a set threshold, a buzzer is triggered, an LED lights up, and a warning is sent to the user via the Blynk IoT platform.
4. **Safety Feedback**:
   - Safe alcohol levels: Green LED ON, Red LED OFF, buzzer beeps briefly.
   - Unsafe levels: Red LED ON, Green LED OFF, continuous alert and IoT notification.
5. **Connectivity**: ESP8266 connects to Wi-Fi to push real-time data to the Blynk dashboard.
